    <h2>Empower · Flip · Light</h2>

    <h3>🚨 Why It Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Trolling isn’t harmless. It’s abuse. For too long, people have been told to “block, delete, ignore.” 
      But silence protects abusers, not victims. The scars don’t vanish when the screen goes dark.
    </p>

    <h3>🔄 Flipping the Script</h3>
    <p>
      The AntiTrollMovement flips the script. Together, we can turn hate into truth, give power back to people, 
      and flood dark spaces with light.
    </p>

    <h3>✊ Every Action Counts</h3>
    <p>
      Every ✊ shows you have someone’s back.<br>
      Every 🔄 turns hate into something better.<br>
      Every 💡 makes the internet brighter.
