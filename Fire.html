  <h2>🔥 The Fire: From Pain to Purpose</h2>
  
  <p>
    The AntiTrollMovement wasn’t just born out of what I saw online.  
    It was born out of what I lived.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I came out of a narcissistic relationship that held up a mirror to who I really am — 
    someone deeply empathetic. For a long time, I thought that made me weak.  
    I was told I was “too soft,” that I saw the good in people when I should’ve toughened up.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But through healing, I realised the truth: <strong>empathy isn’t weakness. It’s power.</strong>  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The real weakness sits with the people who exploit it — trolls, bullies, manipulators.  
    People who weaponise cruelty and call it “normal.” They thrive because our culture lets them.  
    Because silence, excuses, and “that’s just the way it is” protect them.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But empathy flips that script.  
    Empathy says: “I see your hate for what it is, and I won’t mirror it back.  
    I’ll shine a light instead.”  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This isn’t just about me.  
    I know there are thousands of people with stories like mine — survivors of toxic relationships, 
    abuse, or bullying — still struggling to make sense of it. Still wondering if they’re the problem.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I want them to know: you’re not weak. You’re empathetic.  
    And empathy, with boundaries, is the strongest force we’ve got.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Knowledge is power.  
    And when knowledge meets empathy, culture changes.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That’s what AntiTrollMovement stands for.  
    That’s why I flipped my pain into purpose.
