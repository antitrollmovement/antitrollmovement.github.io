    <h1>🔥 The Fire: From Pain to Purpose</h1>

    <p>
      The AntiTrollMovement wasn’t just born out of what I saw online.<br>
      It was born out of what I lived.
    </p>

    <p>
      I came out of a narcissistic relationship that held up a mirror to who I really am — 
      someone deeply empathetic. For a long time, I thought that made me weak. I was told I was 
      “too soft,” that I saw the good in people when I should’ve toughened up.
    </p>

    <p>
      But through healing, I realised the truth: empathy isn’t weakness. It’s power.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real weakness sits with the people who exploit it — trolls, bullies, manipulators. 
      People who weaponise cruelty and call it “normal.” They thrive because our culture lets them. 
      Because silence, excuses, and “that’s just the way it is” protect them.
    </p>

    <p>
      But empathy flips that script.<br>
      Empathy says: “I see your hate for what it is, and I won’t mirror it back. I’ll shine a light instead.”
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn’t just about me.<br>
      I know there are thousands of people with stories like mine — survivors of toxic relationships, 
      abuse, or bullying — still struggling to make sense of it. Still wondering if they’re the problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want them to know: you’re not weak. You’re empathetic. And empathy, with boundaries, is the 
      strongest force we’ve got.
    </p>

    <p>
      Knowledge is power. And when knowledge meets empathy, culture changes.<br>
      That’s what AntiTrollMovement stands for.<br>
      That’s why I flipped my pain into purpose.
