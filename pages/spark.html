    <h1>⚡ The Spark: Where It Began</h1>
    <h3 class="spark-slogan">Don’t erase the hate. Outshine it.</h3>

    <p>
      The AntiTrollMovement didn’t begin with one comment. It began with an
      accumulation of moments the kind you scroll past every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Videos that should’ve been innocent and joyful. A mother proudly sharing
      her twins’ first tastes of food. A family moment that should’ve been safe.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in the comment section, it wasn’t children hiding behind fake names.
      It was adults fully grown men and women tearing her apart, judging,
      ridiculing.
    </p>

    <p>
      And yes, there were kind people too a few voices saying
      <em>“ignore the haters”</em> or <em>“you’re doing great.”</em>
      But the hate was still there. It lingered louder.
    </p>

    <p>
      I remember feeling angry. My first instinct was to fire back, to comment,
      to fight. But deep down, I knew it wouldn’t make a difference. Arguing
      with hate just feeds it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then it hit me: what if we flipped the script?
    </p>

    <p>
      What if, instead of fuelling trolls, we empowered the victims? Not with
      silence. Not just “delete, block, move on.” But by 🔄 flipping the hate
      into 💡 light.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if every dark comment section became a place where empathy stood
      taller than cruelty? Where the hate could stay but it would never be the
      last word. Because we’d flood it with light.
    </p>

    <p>
      That was The Spark. The moment AntiTrollMovement was born.
